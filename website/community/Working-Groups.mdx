title: Moja global working groups
---

Navigating a large and diverse community is difficult, both for coordination and for new participants to find their place. Technical Steering Committee Working Groups groups to provide a central point of coordination for a common set of topics. Each Working Group has one or more coordinators to provide a direct point of contact for the TSC Chair and/or Directors. Working Groups might also request feedback and support from the moja global management, strategy and advisory boards.

## Purpose of a working group

Working Groups are about communication rather than accountability. Accountability is instead delegated to the individuals responsible for a specific project who choose to report their progress to the Working Group for oversight and collaboration. Such reports allow Working Groups to maintain an overview of ongoing development, published on a moja global website or repository to help the community track who is working on what. Each Working Group briefs the TSC at least once per month, and the TSC relays their progress to other moja global boards.

## Participating in a working group

Membership in a working group need only indicate an interest and willingness to help or answer questions, but contributions would be entirely voluntary. Membership should by no means be restricted to the people listed here. It should be fine for anyone to join a Working Group.

Working Groups will hopefully be used for capacity building. Each Working Group will require one or more Coordinators. The Coordinator role may reflect seniority or experience, and potential suitability for mentor roles or funded project opportunities. Other working group members are also likely to be eligible for mentorship, potentially as indicated by the coordinator. Coordinator roles may be self-nominated or unanimously decided by the TSC.

## Forming a new Working Group

Each Working Group will develop Terms of Reference (TOR) that addresses the following questions:

-   Who are the leads/coordinators of the Working Group?    
-   What value do you see your group bringing to the moja global community?    
-   What support do you need, and separately want, from the moja global organization?    
-   What are the goals of your group?
	-   Both in the short term and if relevant over a longer period.
-   Is your group long-running or temporary?
	-   If it is temporary, how long do you see it running? 
	-   If long-running, what is the long-term vision of your group?
-   What are explicitly non-goals of your group? 
-   What do you expect the relationship to the moja global TSC, Management, Strategy and Advisory boards to be?
-   What are your preferred means of communicating? (e.g. Slack, email, Google Meet)    
-   How do you intend to make your work accessible to people outside your group?    
-   How frequently would you like to update your TOR?    
-   How would you like to conduct evaluations of working group progress?    
-   Who are the initial Coordinators? How long is their term?    
-   If applicable, which other groups or teams do you expect to have close contact with?   
-   Where do you see your group needing help?

TOR can be reviewed by the TSC and announced to the wider community.

## Active working groups

This section contains the notes for each of the active working groups. To join any active working group, reach out on the appropriate Slack channel on the moja global workspace or fill up the Google form if linked. If in doubt, drop us a mail at [tsc@moja.global](mailto:tsc@moja.global).

### Documentation working group

The Documentation working group is primarily aimed at developing high-quality user and developer documentation, with well-documented software, tools and projects defined with a standard contribution experience. As a part of the Documentation working group, we work on:

-   Creating user-story based end-user documentation that to simplify complex concepts for better understanding.   
-   Creating modular content that can be reused/repurposed for different formats and different use cases.  
-   Adhering to minimalism practices, logically structuring our content, and endeavouring to make it as findable as possible.
-   Reduce the number of developer/user issues the engineering team needs to deal with on GitHub.

As part of the Documentation Working group, we work asynchronously with the engineering teams to set clear Release, feature freeze, and code freeze dates, which allows us to set our Documentation freeze and even Release Notes dates. Remember, [docs or it didn’t happen](https://opensource.com/business/15/8/docs-or-it-didnt-happen).

The areas we work on are:

-   **Training material**: Moja global’s training material helps contributors upskill quickly and makes them fit to contribute in a short space of time. We publish our training materials over Moodle learning management system (LMS) which will be expanded over time.    
-   **Website maintenance**: We aid in the management and maintenance of our main website and the community website, working around updating content, writing blogs and content which can be published centrally.    
-   **Promotion**: We work on promotional content for social media channels that can be utilized to spread the word about moja global and how people can contribute to our initiative.
-   **Coordination**: Our contributors put a lot of focus on a documentative approach to communication. Every message is written to be reused or referenced in the future. The coordination effort relies on finding these resources which can be integrated with the documentation and coordinating the forums and mailing lists.

We are yet to decide on the tools and technologies that we will employ for our purpose. However some of them that are most commonly employed are [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/features/project-management/). We also would like to use more efficient project management tools to track our documentation and releases and we are open to suggestions for the same.

All the Contributors for the Documentation Working Group are invited to a bi-weekly sync call to discuss the completed, ongoing and pending work. If you would like to join as a volunteer, please fill-up the Google form: [**https://forms.gle/ibH2XsaBSAeiyQcX7**](https://forms.gle/ibH2XsaBSAeiyQcX7)

### DevOps working group

The DevOps working group is primarily aimed at a collaboration-first approach to software by facilitating transparency, shared workloads, continuous feedback and reviews, and robust documentation. As a part of the DevOps working group, we work on:

-   Building CI/CD pipelines for various moja global projects to facilitate continuous testing, deployment and release lifecycle.    
-   Integrating infrastructure-as-a-code tools to manage and deploy our infrastructure over the cloud.  
-   Develop workflows and processes to help moja global teams capitalize on cloud services and resources for continuous development.    
-   Implement observability across application metrics while assisting development teams with operational support.
   
As part of the DevOps working group, you work with the development teams and the documentation team to facilitate operations. Some of our current areas of focus are:

-   **Build pipelines**: Develop a robust and flexible build for a wide array of moja global projects, like FLINT, Reporting Tool, to manage continuous integration and releases.  
-   **Test suite**: Writing unit, integration and end-to-end test suite to be integrated into our core projects, like FLINT-UI, FLINT-Cloud, to help development teams to ship software confidently.    
-   **Automation toolings**: Implementing automated toolings to help contributors with easy installation and setup to facilitate contributions.    
-   **Container Images**: Centralizing container images scattered across the organization and projects under a single umbrella while implementing CI/CD to test and deploy images.
 
We use a wide array of tool-sets and technologies like [Docker](https://docker.io/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to name a few.

All the Contributors for the DevOps Working Group are invited to a bi-weekly sync call to discuss the completed, ongoing and pending work. If you would like to join as a volunteer, please join the `#devops` channel for further updates on the working group.
