title: Moja global working groups
---

Navigating a large and diverse community is difficult, both for coordination and for new participants to find their place. Technical Steering Committee Working Groups groups to provide a central point of coordination for a common set of topics. Each Working Group has one or more coordinators to provide a direct point of contact for the TSC Chair and/or Directors. Working Groups might also request feedback and support from the moja global management, strategy and advisory boards.

## Purpose of a working group

Working Groups are about communication rather than accountability. Accountability is instead delegated to the individuals responsible for a specific project who choose to report their progress to the Working Group for oversight and collaboration. Such reports allow Working Groups to maintain an overview of ongoing development, published on a moja global website or repository to help the community track who is working on what. Each Working Group briefs the TSC at least once per month, and the TSC relays their progress to other moja global boards.

## Participating in a working group

Membership in a working group need only indicate an interest and willingness to help or answer questions, but contributions would be entirely voluntary. Membership should by no means be restricted to the people listed here. It should be fine for anyone to join a Working Group.

Working Groups will hopefully be used for capacity building. Each Working Group will require one or more Coordinators. The Coordinator role may reflect seniority or experience, and potential suitability for mentor roles or funded project opportunities. Other working group members are also likely to be eligible for mentorship, potentially as indicated by the coordinator. Coordinator roles may be self-nominated or unanimously decided by the TSC.

## Forming a new Working Group

Each Working Group will develop Terms of Reference (TOR) that addresses the following questions:

-   Who are the leads/coordinators of the Working Group?    
-   What value do you see your group bringing to the moja global community?    
-   What support do you need, and separately want, from the moja global organization?    
-   What are the goals of your group?
	-   Both in the short term and if relevant over a longer period.
-   Is your group long-running or temporary?
	-   If it is temporary, how long do you see it running? 
	-   If long-running, what is the long-term vision of your group?
-   What are explicitly non-goals of your group? 
-   What do you expect the relationship to the moja global TSC, Management, Strategy and Advisory boards to be?
-   What are your preferred means of communicating? (e.g. Slack, email, Google Meet)    
-   How do you intend to make your work accessible to people outside your group?    
-   How frequently would you like to update your TOR?    
-   How would you like to conduct evaluations of working group progress?    
-   Who are the initial Coordinators? How long is their term?    
-   If applicable, which other groups or teams do you expect to have close contact with?   
-   Where do you see your group needing help?

TOR can be reviewed by the TSC and announced to the wider community.
